  <h2>Project Write-Up</h2>
  <p>The main goal of this project is to explore cancer occurrences (per capita) in relation to industrial plants, air
    quality, and water quality. There are many ways to approach this, and currently we are experimenting with different
    ideas. We aim to create an interactive visualization of the U.S. that displays cancer density along with animated
    logos representing various industries.

    We are working to generate summary statistics, and we want our data to be at the county level. Essentially, the
    viewer will be able to interact with the map and click on specific counties. Each county will display information
    about its cancer rate, as well as detailed data regarding air quality, water quality, and any known industrial
    plants within the area.</p>
